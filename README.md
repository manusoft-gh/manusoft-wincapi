C++ classes for managing Windows CryptoAPI resources

This set of header-only utility classes wraps many CryptoAPI resources, data
structures, and functionality for easier and more reliable consumption by
C++ code. The main header CAPI.h includes all the more specific headers. All
classes are defined inside the CAPI namespace.

To use the classes, include the main header file:

#include "CAPI.h"
